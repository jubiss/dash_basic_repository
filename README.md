This repository serves as a template for creating applications with Dash, a powerful Python framework for building interactive web applications. Whether you're starting a new project or looking to organize an existing Dash application, this template provides a solid foundation to get you up and running quickly.

## Features

- Organized directory structure for separating code, assets, and data.
- Pre-configured development environment with necessary dependencies.
- Example application showcasing the basic structure and usage of Dash.

## Getting Started

To use this repository template, simply click the "Use this template" button on the GitHub repository page. This will create a new repository based on this template in your account.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jubiss/dash_basic_repository.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd your-repo
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python3 -m venv env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to do the steps from 3 to 5 and add my personal components, that I use in my projects just use the install.bat

### Usage

1. Customize the Dash application layouts in the `apps` directory.
2. Add any necessary assets (e.g., CSS files, images) in the `assets` directory.
3. Update the application's callbacks in the `callback_app` directory
4. Create the data processing logic in the `data` directory.
4. Run the application locally for testing and development:

```
python index.py
```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8050` to view the application.

### Deployment

The deployment of your Dash application will depend on your hosting provider and specific requirements. Please refer to the Dash documentation for deployment options and guidelines.
